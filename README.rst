============================
Particle Notification Button
============================

This project uses a Particle Internet Button to create an Internet-connected notification device.

Notifications can be triggered through a HTTP request to Particle's API, enabling any IoT device to trigger a notification.

Motivation
==========

I needed to get notified of events through visual and audible feedbacks, regardless of which monitor, computer, or headphone was currently in use in my office.

The Particle Internet Button was chosen for its ease of use and pre-wired 11 LEDs, buzzer and buttons.

Alternative use
===============

I find the Particle Internet Button extremely useful with LittleSleeper, to monitor noise level around a baby crib. Using the `littlesleeper_notifier.py`, the Particle Internet Button displays the noise intensity as a progressive a LED circle.
